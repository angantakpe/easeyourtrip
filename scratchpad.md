# EaseYourTrip Document AI - Image Processing Bug Fix

## Task Description

Fix the image processing pipeline in the EaseYourTrip Document AI application to handle file extension mismatches correctly, resolve CSV logging issues, and fix classification errors.

## Current Status

✅ **FIXED**: The image processing pipeline is now working correctly. The application successfully processes images without file extension mismatch errors.

✅ **FIXED**: The CSV logging issue has been resolved by implementing proper path handling for both file and directory paths.

✅ **FIXED**: The classification error (`'str' object has no attribute 'get'`) has been resolved by properly checking database query results.

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: External service logging system to track all requests and responses to external services.

Previous errors:

```python
Exception in making image hash as :: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'static/35693725-a045-405d-93f9-97309b93284d.jpg'
Excepion in DocProcess as : cannot access local variable 'img_hash' where it is not associated with a value
```

```bash
An error occurred: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '' savecsv_log
```

```bash
An error occurred: [Errno 13] Permission denied: './logs/' savecsv_log
```

```bash
Exception in get_category as 'str' object has no attribute 'get'
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test the application to ensure all issues are resolved
2. ✅ Fix the CSV logging functionality issue
3. ✅ Fix the classification error
4. ✅ Implement comprehensive external service logging
5. [ ] Consider adding more robust error handling throughout the codebase
6. [ ] Monitor the external service logs to identify potential performance bottlenecks

## External Service Logging Implementation

The new external service logging system captures detailed information about all interactions with external services:

1. **Request Logging**: Before making a request to an external service, the system logs:
   - Service name (e.g., "Azure_OCR", "Database", "Cache")
   - Endpoint/operation (e.g., "read_in_stream", "query", "insert")
   - Request payload (with sensitive data filtered)
   - Request ID for traceability
   - Timestamp

2. **Response Logging**: After receiving a response, the system logs:
   - Service name and endpoint
   - Response data (summarized for large responses)
   - Status code
   - Error information (if any)
   - Request ID for correlation with the request
   - Timestamp

3. **Error Handling**: All exceptions during external service calls are captured and logged with:
   - Detailed error messages
   - Stack traces
   - Request context

4. **Log Storage**: All logs are stored in JSON format in the `logs/external_services` directory with filenames that include:
   - Service name
   - Request ID
   - Timestamp
   - Operation type (request/response)

This implementation provides a complete audit trail of all external service interactions, making it easier to debug issues, monitor performance, and analyze patterns of service usage.

## Lessons

- Consistent file extension handling is critical in image processing pipelines
- Always include fallback mechanisms for file operations
- Add detailed error logging to help diagnose issues
- When working with image files, always check if the file exists before attempting to open it
- Use consistent path handling (forward slashes vs. backslashes) across the codebase
- Implement robust error handling for all file operations
- Test with various image formats to ensure compatibility
- Always provide default paths when environment variables might not be set
- Create directories if they don't exist before writing files to them
- When handling file paths from environment variables, check if they point to directories or files
- For directory paths, append a default filename to create a valid file path
- Always check the status of database operations before trying to access the results
- Implement proper error handling for database queries to prevent cascading errors
- Use defensive programming techniques to handle potential null or invalid values
- Implement comprehensive logging for all external service interactions to facilitate debugging
- Pass request_id to all functions that interact with external services for end-to-end traceability
- Store logs in structured formats (like JSON) to make them easier to analyze
- Create log directories during application startup to avoid runtime errors
