# EaseYourTrip Document AI - Image Processing Bug Fix

## Task Description

Fix the image processing pipeline in the EaseYourTrip Document AI application to handle file extension mismatches correctly, resolve CSV logging issues, and fix classification errors.

## Current Status

✅ **FIXED**: The image processing pipeline is now working correctly. The application successfully processes images without file extension mismatch errors.

✅ **FIXED**: The CSV logging issue has been resolved by implementing proper path handling for both file and directory paths.

✅ **FIXED**: The classification error (`'str' object has no attribute 'get'`) has been resolved by properly checking database query results.

Previous errors:

```python
Exception in making image hash as :: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'static/35693725-a045-405d-93f9-97309b93284d.jpg'
Excepion in DocProcess as : cannot access local variable 'img_hash' where it is not associated with a value
```

```bash
An error occurred: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '' savecsv_log
```

```bash
An error occurred: [Errno 13] Permission denied: './logs/' savecsv_log
```

```bash
Exception in get_category as 'str' object has no attribute 'get'
```

## Progress

- [X] Fixed `getDPI` function in `util.py` to handle different file extensions
- [X] Fixed `crop_image` function in `image_preprocessing.py` to handle different file extensions
- [X] Fixed `preprocess_image` function in `image_preprocessing.py` to handle different file extensions
- [X] Fixed `crop_and_generate_image_url` function in `image_preprocessing.py` to handle different file extensions
- [X] Fixed image hash creation in `img_process` function in `main.py`
- [X] Fixed CSV logging in `savecsv_log` function in `logs.py` to handle missing environment variables
- [X] Enhanced CSV logging to handle directory paths in `CSV_LOG_PATH`
- [X] Fixed `get_category` function in `classify.py` to properly check database query results
- [X] Fixed `get_category_text` function in `classify.py` to properly check database query results
- [X] Tested the application - image processing now works correctly

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test the application to ensure all issues are resolved
2. ✅ Fix the CSV logging functionality issue
3. ✅ Fix the classification error
4. [ ] Consider adding more robust error handling throughout the codebase
5. [ ] Add more detailed logging to help diagnose similar issues in the future

## Lessons

- Consistent file extension handling is critical in image processing pipelines
- Always include fallback mechanisms for file operations
- Add detailed error logging to help diagnose issues
- When working with image files, always check if the file exists before attempting to open it
- Use consistent path handling (forward slashes vs. backslashes) across the codebase
- Implement robust error handling for all file operations
- Test with various image formats to ensure compatibility
- Always provide default paths when environment variables might not be set
- Create directories if they don't exist before writing files to them
- When handling file paths from environment variables, check if they point to directories or files
- For directory paths, append a default filename to create a valid file path
- Always check the status of database operations before trying to access the results
- Implement proper error handling for database queries to prevent cascading errors
- Use defensive programming techniques to handle potential null or invalid values
